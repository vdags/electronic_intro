\# Arduino Introduction



This repository is the result of my first tests with an Arduino to introduce myself to electronics. 

Therefore, I if you see any inacurracy within codes, schematics or readmes, please feel free to comment in comment section.

I hope this repo would help others to start with electronics.



This ```/tests``` contains basic tests I have done with components comming from elegoo introductory kit and other basic sensors kit.

This repo aggregate many examples (code + schematics) I have found here and there. \_I have tested them all.\_ Those examples or generally so basic that they or often thought for further component testing.



More simple examples but mixing several components are in ```\\basics```.





\## Component list



Here is the list of components I have used. Corresponding datasheets are in ```/datasheets```.

All of that cost me around 30€ (Arduino excluded) on some Chinese sellers, for the components I have tested, all of them where working.



\### Sensors

| Name| Measure |Output type| Precision | response time(ms) |Cost(€) |Complete Name | Comments|

| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |

| DHT11| Temperature + Hygrometry  |Digital|+/- 1°C / +/- 15%||~3|Content Cell  |hygrometry value often 10-15% lower than real value|
